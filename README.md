# GLNS

A Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) Solver.  

This solver is implemented in Julia (<http://julialang.org/>).  It is now **compatible with Julia v1.0.  Update Julia to v1.0 before running GLNS.**

More information on the solver is given at <https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~sl2smith/GLNS/>

## Using the solver

GLNS has three default settings: slow, default, and fast.  
It also has several flags that can be used to give to give the solver  
timeout, or to have it quit when a solution cost threshold is met.

The solver can be run from the command line or from the Julia REPL.

The input to the solver is a text file in
[GTSPLIB format](http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/home/zvero/GTSPLIB/), which is an extension of the
[TSPLIB format](https://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/).

### Running from the command line


Julia has a startup time of approximately 0.5 seconds, which gives this  
option a delay over option two below.  The syntax is as follows:


`$ ./GLNScmd.jl <path_to_instance> -options`

The following are a few examples

```$ ./GLNScmd.jl test/39rat195.gtsp
$ ./GLNScmd.jl test/39rat195.gtsp -mode=fast -output=tour.txt```

GLNS can also be set to run "persistently" for a given amount of time.   
The following example will run for 60 seconds before terminating.

`$ ./GLNScmd.jl test/39rat195.gtsp -max_time=60 -trials=100000`

### Running from the Julia REPL

For this method you should launch Julia, include the GLNS module, and then   
call the solver. This is done as follows:

```
$ julia
julia> include("GLNS.jl")
julia> GLNS.solver("<path_to_instance>", options)
```

The following are a few examples.  The first is the default setting.  The   
last example is a persistent solver that will run for at most 60 seconds,   
but will quit if it finds a tour of cost 13,505 or less (the best known solution    
for this instance is 13,502):

```
julia> GLNS.solver("test/39rat195.gtsp")
julia> GLNS.solver("test/39rat195.gtsp", mode="slow")
julia> GLNS.solver("test/107si535.gtsp", max_time=60, budget=13505, trials=100000)
```
